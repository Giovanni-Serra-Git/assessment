              I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
              from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
              interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself
              master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my
              attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his
              whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,
              buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week
              between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the
              fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply
              attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties
              and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those
              clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as
              hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some
              vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of
              the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of
              the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission
              which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the
              reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity,
              however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily
              press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

              One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning
              from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
              practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the
              well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind
              with my wooing, and with the dark incclassents of the Study in Scarlet,
              I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how
              he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were
              brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare
              figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was
              pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest
              and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and
              habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work
              again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon
              the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to
              the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

              His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
              think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye,
              he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and
              indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood
              before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective
              fashion.
